# Example Discord Notification Configuration
# This file demonstrates the format for notification configuration files

# Discord webhook URL where the notification will be sent
webhook_url: "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID/YOUR_WEBHOOK_TOKEN"

# Message content - supports multi-line text using YAML literal block scalar (|)
# The | character preserves newlines and trailing newline
# Date placeholders: {date} (DD/MM/YYYY), {date:DD/MM}, {date:DD/MM/YYYY}
message: |
  Good morning! 🌅
  
  Today's date is {date} (or {date:DD/MM} for short format).
  
  This is a multi-line message example.
  Each line will be preserved as written.
  
  You can include:
  - Bullet points
  - Multiple paragraphs
  - Special characters: @#$%^&*()
  - Date placeholders: {date} and {date:DD/MM}
  
  Have a great day on {date:DD/MM/YYYY}!

# Alternative: Using folded block scalar (>) for long single-line messages
# message: >
#   This is a long message that will be folded into a single line
#   with spaces replacing newlines. Useful for long text that you
#   want to format nicely in the config file but send as one line.
